        <h2>About AS400191</h2>
        <p>AS400191 (Indent Solutions) is an Autonomous System Number registered to Indent Solutions. The purpose of the ASN is to operate BGP sessions with providers across the globe to collect global routing information. They allow Indent to capture the data and analyze it for patterns and anomalies. BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, is used to exchange routing information between organizations. Without it, the internet would cease to function. However, there are security concerns with the current implementation of BGP. Many Tier 1 providers do not fully validate their connected routes. This can cause massive IP hijacks, such as the one occurring to Amazon Web Services in 2018. To prevent this, network operations began to roll out Resource Public Key Infrastructure, more easily known as RPKI. This allows for the verification of IP space ownership by limiting the source announcement of IP blocks. The system works well as long as providers validate against invalid RPKI and network operators enable RPKI for their assigned IP space. This continues to be a challenge as 60% of the routes seen in the global routing table still do not have any ROA entries in the RPKI databases. Therefore now allowing RPKI validation to ensure their space stays hijack-free.</p>
        <p>This network is currently in development and will be peering with several networks across the US to gain routing data. Once enough data is collected, statistics will be posted here. Please find network and organization information below.</p>
