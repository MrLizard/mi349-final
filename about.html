        <h2>About AS400191</h2>
        <p>AS400191 (Indent Solutions) is an Autonomous System Number registered to Indent Solutions. The pourpose of the ASN is to operate BGP sessions with proviers across the globe in order to collect global routing information. Allowing Indent to capture the data and analayse it for patterns and anomolies. BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol is used to exchange routing information between organizations. Without it the internet would cease to function. There are security concerns with the current implementation of BGP. There are many Tier 1 providers who do not fully validate their connected routes. This can cause massive IP hijacks such as the one occuring to Amazon Web Services in 2018. In order to prevent this, network operations began to roll out Resource Public Key Infrastructure, more easily known as RPKI. This allows for the verification of IP space ownership by limiting the source announcement of IP blocks. The system works well as long as providers validate against invalid RPKI, and as long as network operators enable RPKI for their assigned IP space. This continues to be a challenge as 60% of the routes seen in the global routing table still do not have any ROA entries in the RPKI databases. Therefor now allowing RPKI validation to ensure their space stay hijack free.</p>
        <p>This network currently is in devleopment and will be peering with several networks across the US to gain routing data. Once enough data is collected, statistics will be posted here. Please find network and organization information below.</p>
